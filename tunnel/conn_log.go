// In full-tunnel mode the stack sees every flow's 5-tuple and (via the UID
// resolver) the owning UID. This lets us:
//   • attribute DNS queries to the real app (the legacy ServeDNS path only
//     knew "RootProxy" in VPN mode), and
//   • surface actual connections (TCP/UDP) — the only way to see apps like
//     Telegram / WhatsApp that connect to hard-coded IPs and barely use DNS,
//     so nothing shows in a DNS-only log.
//
// UID→package uses AppUidResolver (int arg only) — NOT AppResolver, whose
// []byte args panic under Go's cgocheck when called from this concurrent
// hot path.
